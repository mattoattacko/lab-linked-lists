![cf](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Linked List Data Structure
================================================================

## Submission Instructions
* Follow the data structures submission instructions

### Before you begin
* You'll need to initialize the implementation folder as a new node module, install your dependencies, setup your npm script commands, and pull in your config files


## Requirements
* implement a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structure
* implement `append(value)`, `prepend(value)`, `reverse()`, and `remove(offset)` methods to the SLL class
* implement `serialize()` and `deserialize()` methods on the class
* in a comment within each function, note the it's Big-O runtime

* implement a Doubly Linked List (DLL) data structure
* implement `append(value)`, `prepend(value)`, `reverse()`, and `remove(offset)` methods to the SLL class
* implement `serialize()` and `deserialize()` methods on the class
* in a comment within each function, note the it's Big-O runtime

#### Testing
  * write at least three test assertions for each method of the Linked List Data Structure
  * organize your tests into appropriate describe/it blocks for test output readability

####  Documentation
  * in your README, write documentation for you data structures
  * your documentation should includes code block useage examples
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests
